	<p>WASHINGTON: Some people are two-faced, figuratively speaking of course. The ancient Roman god Janus was two-faced, literally — with one looking forward and another backward, representing transitions and duality. But a two-faced star? Yes, indeed.</p>
	<p>Scientists have observed a white dwarf star — a hot stellar remnant that is among the densest objects in the cosmos — that they have nicknamed Janus owing to the fact it has the peculiar distinction of being composed of hydrogen on one side and helium on the other.</p>
	<p>“Janus is the Roman god with two faces, so we thought it was very appropriate. Moreover, Janus is the god of transition, and the white dwarf might be currently transitioning from having an atmosphere made of hydrogen to one made of helium,” said Ilaria Caiazzo, a Caltech postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics and lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.</p>
	<p>The star is located in our Milky Way galaxy about 1,300 light years from Earth in the direction of the Cygnus constellation. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1766126/scientists-spot-two-faced-white-dwarf-star">Read More...</a></p>

	<h1>Quantum Matter Breakthrough: Researchers Uncover Unique Quantum Behavior</h1>

	<p>Researchers from EPFL have discovered a new way to create a crystalline structure called a “density wave” in an atomic gas. This breakthrough can help us better understand the behavior of quantum matter, one of the most complex problems in physics.
	“Cold atomic gases were well known in the past for the ability to ‘program’ the interactions between atoms,” says Professor Jean-Philippe Brantut at EPFL. “Our experiment doubles this ability!” Working with the group of Professor Helmut Ritsch at the University of Innsbruck, they have made a breakthrough that can impact not only quantum research but quantum-based technologies in the future. </p>
	<h3>Density waves</h3>
	<p>Scientists have long been interested in understanding how materials self-organize into complex structures, such as crystals. In the often-arcane world of quantum physics, this sort of self-organization of particles is seen in ‘density waves’, where particles arrange themselves into a regular, repeating pattern or ‘order’; like a group of people with different colored shirts standing in a line but in a pattern where no two people with the same color shirt stand next to each other.</p>
	<p>Density waves are observed in a variety of materials, including metals, insulators, and superconductors. However, studying them has been difficult, especially when this order (the patterns of particles in the wave) occurs with other types of organization such as superfluidity – a property that allows particles to flow without resistance.</p>
	<p>It’s worth noting that superfluidity is not just a theoretical curiosity; it is of immense interest for developing materials with unique properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, which could lead to more efficient energy transfer and storage, or for building quantum computers. <a target="_blank" href="https://scitechdaily.com/quantum-matter-breakthrough-researchers-uncover-unique-quantum-behavior/">Read More...</a></p>

	<p>NASA scientists opened a discussion on Thursday (July 20) to outline key solutions they've been working on to mitigate the dire effects of global warming. </p>
	<p>As heat waves continue to sweep across Earth, wildfires burn across North America and natural disasters like hurricanes increase in severity – all consequences of human-induced climate change – the space agency is paying attention and looking for ways it can help mitigate the effects of a warming planet. "This last June was the warmest June on record," Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said. "And we anticipate, with the understanding of what's going on, on a day by day basis, that July is likely to be the warmest absolute month on record." </p>
	<p>To be clear, that's a record that goes back many hundreds, if not thousands, of years, he said.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.space.com/nasa-discusses-record-temperatures-climate-solutions">Read More...</a> </p>
